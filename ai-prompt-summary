Create a Power Apps tool that generates a dynamic maternity leave plan based on employee-specific inputs.

The app collects:

Employee name

Due date

Optional WFH (work-from-home) start date

Toggles for:

Taking all 6 weeks of M3 paid leave (2 weeks child care + 4 weeks maternity)

Using PTO (with specified number of days)

Taking unpaid leave (with specified number of days)

Doing a transition plan (with number of transition months)

The app logic then:

Builds a day-by-day leave schedule starting from the due date.

Skips weekends and uses AppPayrollCalendar2025 to:

Recognize holidays

Account for observed holidays (e.g., if a holiday falls on a Saturday, it’s observed on Friday).

Inserts leave types in strict order:

Paid Child Care Leave (10 weekdays)

Paid Maternity Leave (20 weekdays)

PTO, if enabled

Unpaid Leave, if enabled

Transition Plan, calculated as months × 20 weekdays

Holidays do not count against Paid Leave, PTO, or Unpaid days, but do count toward FMLA if flagged in the AppFMLARules list.

The app ensures leave blocks extend to maintain exact counts (e.g., 10 Paid Child Care Leave days, even if holidays interrupt).

Uses pay period dates from AppPayrollCalendar2025 to annotate each leave day.

Displays a readable summary on screen two using a Concat() text label, where each line shows:

Day of week

Date

Leave type

Pay period code and date range

FMLA status (yes/no)

Note: Transition Plan days always show “FMLA: no” in the summary, regardless of other rules.
